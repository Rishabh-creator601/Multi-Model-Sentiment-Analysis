## 📌 Project Description

This project is a Multi-Model Sentiment Evaluation App built using Streamlit.
It allows users to analyze the sentiment of a given text using multiple sentiment analysis approaches at once.
Instead of relying on a single model, the app compares predictions from:
Rule-based models (VADER)
Statistical models (TextBlob)
Machine Learning models (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost)
All model outputs are shown together, and a final sentiment decision is generated based on the combined result.
This project is mainly focused on learning, comparison, and practical implementation of NLP sentiment techniques.
